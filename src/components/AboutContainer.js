            <h2>David Rafe</h2>
            <h4>I love learning every single day, and the most exciting part is that my journey with code has just begun. I've been able to quickly pick up concepts such as Object-Orientation, and MVC style responsibilities utilizing Ruby on Rails and Javascript(ES6). I've been able to incorporate frontend frameworks and technologies such as React and Redux, in conjunction with a Rails backend setup, in a matter of weeks. I am excited to continue to explore what else is out there, and what I can do with it.</h4>
